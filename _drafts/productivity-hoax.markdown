Productivity is a mental construct where in a certain amount of time you try to maximize the output of your work. But who sets these objectives? How much work is enough to consider you had a productive day?

## Then

Back in the day this was pretty much dictated by nature. When our ancestors worked the land they could physically achieve only so much and the yield depended mostly on weather. They worked within the constraints of their agricultural knowledge and physical capabilities and hoped for the best. They had been doing it to survive as they perfectly understood their relationship with nature, much better than modern human does, so the incentive to be useful wasn’t lacking.

Then came slavery, where some people oppressed others to work for them and steal the fruits of their labor. It became widespread with the invention of agriculture, but mostly in a form of punishment for crime, debt, for prisoners or war and so on. It wasn’t until 14th century that the massive organized slavery for economic gain developed.[^1] Given that soul-crushing forced labor isn’t exactly inspiring in its character, the slave owners had to “apply” life-threatening physical torture to encourage their slaves to be more _productive_.

Over centuries capitalism gradually evolved from using slaves to wage employing everybody, including children, to work 16 hours a day, 6 days a week. That is to say — only after you had been toiling during every waking hour of your day, your employer would consider you productive.

## Now

Humanity has come a long way since, but some striking similarities still remain in modern times. Employees today live with the same urge of productivity, imposed through the expectations of their employers. Likewise, economic and social environment imposes similar expectations on employers.

Today it’s considered productive if you work close to 8 hours, 5 days a week doing things from your job description. Less than two centuries ago everybody, including children, had to toil for excruciating 16 hours a day, 6 days a week to be considered productive.

What productive means is clearly an artificial fabrication. It doesn’t come from nature, it doesn’t even come from the real economy, but from the insane aspiration for perpetual economic growth.

Graeber bullshit jobs

Context is everything, working conditions, salary, safety. It's much less of a personal trait, current mental state, sleep etc.

Productive to whom? You want to feel good about yourself, to satisfy your internal creative desire, Or to satisfy your employer, so you feel safe and don't get fired from your job.

You don't procrastinate because you didn't get enough sleep, you’re not hydrated well or you’re in a bad mood, but because you don't find meaning in your work, you dislike people you're working with etc.
