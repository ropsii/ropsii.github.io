Productivity is a mental construct where in a certain amount of time you try to maximize your output. But how do we know how much is enough and who sets productivity objectives?

Back in the day this was pretty much dictated by nature. When our ancestors worked the land they could physically achieve only so much and the yield depended mostly on weather. They worked within the constraints of their agricultural knowledge and physical capabilities and hoped for the best. They had to do it to survive and they perfectly understood their relationship with the nature, much better than modern human does, so the incentive to be useful wasn’t lacking.

Then came slavery, where some people physically oppressed others to work for them and steal the fruits of their labor. It became widespread with the invention of agriculture, but mostly in a form of punishment for crime, debt, for prisoners or war and so on. It wasn’t until 14th century that the massive organized slavery for economic gain developed.[^1] Soul crushing forced hard labor isn’t exactly inspiring in its nature, so the slave owners had to “apply” life-threatening physical torture to encourage their slaves to be more _productive_.

Humanity has come a long way since, but some striking similarities still remain in modern times. Employees today live with the urge of productivity, to satisfy the expectations of their employers. Likewise, economic and social environment imposes similar expectations on employers and everybody lives in the same inferno of productivity.


Context is everything, working conditions, salary, safety. It's much less of a personal trait, current mental state, sleep etc.

Productive to whom? You want to feel good about yourself, to satisfy your internal creative desire, Or to satisfy your employer, so you feel safe and don't get fired from your job.
