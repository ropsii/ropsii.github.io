Context is everything, working conditions, salary, safety. It's much less of a personal trait, current mental state, sleep etc.

Productive to whom? You want to feel good about yourself, to satisfy your internal creative desire, Or to satisfy your employer, so you feel safe and don't get fired from your job.
