Criticizing someone’s work is never easy. No matter how experienced they are, there’s a good chance your feedback could sound too subjective and personal even if you didn’t intend to.

Having been on the both sides, both receiving and giving feedback, I came up with a simple “framework” for commenting design.

**Bring the discussion to the objective field.** Focus first on things that aren’t a matter of taste and personal preference. Whether a screen or flow provide enough value for the user, match their expectations, solves the problems and taking them from A to B. Things that can be measured though testing and research.
