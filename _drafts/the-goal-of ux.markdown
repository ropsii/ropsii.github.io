When we’re just starting out in design, most of us are driven by a simple desire to make things pretty. There’s no greater motivation, we’re moving rectangles and letters around, trying to put them together in harmony. You could say we’re trying to selfishly make ourselves feel good.

As we grow more mature, our understanding moves away from beautifying things to making things that are essentially right. Around that point we start talking about users and _satisfying their needs_. It’s not about us anymore, not only what makes us feel good, but what makes people interacting with our software happy. And ideally the product is valuable enough so our users are willing to pay for it.

Most [UX literature]({% post_url 2019-09-29-ux-books-suck %}) stop there. As it is most commonly defined, user experience design is about harmonizing the needs of users with the goals of business. “Goals of business” usually equalling profit. If a product is making money, things are good. That’s about the only relevant metric today.

I always had issues with that. When you strip the relationship between all parties involved to profit, it develops all sorts of _negative externalities_. In economics, negative externality is undesired effect on third party, like pollution, for example.

In business of software, most obvious consequence of overly strong desire to maximize profits is privacy violation. You want to learn more about human habits, how they consume goods and services, then you spy on them and track their every move, so you eventually force them to spend more.

Or using dark UX practices to blatantly cheat people. Deliberately designing user interfaces to mislead people, again, to get more of their money. Or disrupting markets
