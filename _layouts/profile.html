        <div class="serif f5 f3-m mb3">
            <p class="mb3">My expertise is in design and production of web applications. For more than a decade I’ve been helping various products be more useful and meaningful.</p>
            <p class="mb3">Currently I work on <a href="https://semaphoreci.com">Semaphore</a>, a robust continuous integration tool for developers. I run product design and help shape product strategy.</p>
            <img src="{% link /assets/pp.jpg %}" alt="Petar Perovic" class="db mv4">
            <p class="mb3">In past I was at innovative home insurance startup <a href="https://hellosuper.com">Super</a>, lead design at a project management app <a href="https://activecollab.com">ActiveCollab</a>, and ran a design consultancy <a href="https://sprawsm.com">Superawesome</a>.</p>
            <p class="mb3">My previous work with Semaphore was <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/semaphore">featured on Typewolf</a>, a website that lists outstanding typography on the web. I didn’t work on the current website, though.</p>
            <p class="mb3">Every once in a while I’m invited to speak at industry events, mostly sharing what I know about product design and typography.</p>
            <p class="mb3">I’ve been living in Porto, Portugal for years now, and my hometown is Novi Sad, Serbia.</p>
            <p class="mb4">I lazy tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/ropsii">@ropsii</a>. Send me a direct message on Twitter if you want to contact me.</p>
            <p class="f6 mb0">This website doesn’t track or collect any data. It’s running on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>.
