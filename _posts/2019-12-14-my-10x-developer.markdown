In engineering driven organizations, in my experience, design is always slightly undervalued. Even when its importance is recognized, I’ve witnessed many times how difficult it is to achieve excellence in design when company spirit is rooted in engineering.

Having worked in this environment for most of my career, it made me appreciate developers that have a certain jest for product design, that I could team up with to get the most out of design under the specific circumstances.

Most of the developers, however, are in a different group. They are soldiers. They conform to the very distinct lines of responsibility — designers design, and following their input developers develop. Writing software is already difficult enough, so keeping these two activities distinctly apart seemingly makes sense.

I used to believe in that _division of labour_. When I was younger, I’d secretly roll my eyes at comments coming from non-designers because they, of course, should never lecture designers about design. But soon I’d begin facing problems where I’d ran out of capacity when challenged with too much complexity. And as I would almost instantly learn, the feedback I’d get every day was often much more clever than anything I could come up on my own.

All creative work, UX design included, is to a great degree a question of persistance. I firmly believe everybody can do UX design. As a matter of fact everybody in a company is doing it, whether they’re aware of it or not. But in the end of the day designers hold the ownership and responsibility for staying with the problem longer.

Our principal duty is to hear and understand all sides and perspectives, and to synthesize it into what is of the biggest value for our users. In this process, everybody who informs the design is incredibly important.

At a practical level, however, the work we create and the UIs our users interact with depend on developers, so it wouldn’t be unfair to say their engagement with design is slightly more important as it has more impact on our work.

In every team I’ve been a part of, I worked with developers more eager to participate in the design than the others. They understand you’re on the same job, just with different tools. Their feedback is priceless. They introduce you into the inner workings of the system, unlocking perspectives you otherwise would struggle to discover on your own. They make design better and they make you a better designer. They’re my 10x developers.

Individual credit in software is a myth. There are marvelous musicians and artists, individuals whose wonderful gift leaves you speechless, but not in software. No matter what they convinced us to believe about Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Some individuals can impact the organization differently from the others, congratulations, but what we end up admiring in software is always the result of the collective effort. As most people building software learn sooner or later.
