Designers need a constant reminder about the fundamentals of good UI design. The goal of graphic design in user interfaces is to make content accessible, understandable and easier to consume.

However, that gets neglected, sometimes under the burden of trends, and often out of a personal preference or sheer complexity of the interface that designer is trying to _domesticate_.

We tend to sterilize our work. I do it all the time. In order to fight the visual complexity we remove too many _signals_ and our UIs become unintentionally worse. When there’s not enough signal, eyes can’t stop and rest, and user feels lost. When there’s too many, UI gets messy and incoherent.

Fine-tuning the right amount of signal is absolutely the principal goal of design in software interfaces and also graphic design in general.

So, what is a signal? In broadest sense – all elements in a layout compete for our attention and signal is what gives some of them more importance and meaning. Underlined text on the web usually means it’s a link, bold text emphasizes the importance, bigger font size also, and so on. Everything that sets something apart from uniformity is a signal.

## How to make a slower UI?

Yet, design is equally an effort to make things uniform and this is the counter-force that provokes the excessive intervention. We make links hard to identify or choose color so poorly that contrast drops way below accessible values. We use tiny, hard to read font sizes. We abuse font weight just as much. Thin fonts in longform are painful to read, yet designers insist  it’s beautiful. Even Google, a company that arguably hires the best people in the world, at the time of writing this uses `font-weight:300;` for body copy on their official blog. That’s hardly a bearable reading experience even on the retina display, and good luck reading that on an average cheap monitor.

Mistreating the fundamentals increases the cognitive load. Users need an additional couple of seconds when they’re not sure if some text is a link. More while squinting at the thin, light-gray passage of text. And even more to figure out a poorly described feature. And that’s only the graphic design layer. Not to mention the effects of interaction on the speed of understanding the UI.

## Fundamentals precede creativity

In software UIs whose principal duty is to explain, guide and act as the extension of human brain, intervening on foundations must be minimal. Browser defaults are carefully configured for usability before we start to tear them apart. That’s not to say you shouldn’t, but the next time you think of replacing those “ugly” blue underlined links for something more elegant, remember that in software — _usable is beautiful_.
