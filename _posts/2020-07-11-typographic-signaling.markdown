**We need a constant reminder** about the fundamentals of good UI design. The end goal has always been to make the content easier to consume, more usable and understandable. However, that gets often neglected, sometimes under the burden of trends, and sometimes out of a personal preference or simply inexperience.

**Designers tend to sterilize their work.** In order to make things harmonious and reduce visual complexity we often remove too many signals and our UIs become unintentionally worse. When there’s not enough signal, eyes can’t stop and rest, and users feel lost. When there’s too many, the UI gets messy and incoherent.

All of the above is true for design in general, but UIs add additional complexity as elements on the screen are dynamic - they’re changing when we interact with software. So we need a system of consistent signals that correctly communicate hierarchy when users jump back and forth between the screens. That is often too much complexity for designers as there’s simply too many moving parts to keep in agreement.


**What is a signal?** All elements in a design compete for our attention. When everything is set in the same typeface, font size, weight and color – everything is equally meaningless. Designer adds signals to mark things that are more important than others, hoping to make visual hierarchy that leads the eyes and make the readers understand the design better. It can be anything from typeface, font size, font weight, grouping, underlining, letter spacing, white space, using color and so on. Everything different from the uniform surrounding mass is a signal.


- underline the links
- use enough contrast (chrome contrast checker)
- make titles bigger ()
- use enough contract in font weight
- use readable font sizes
