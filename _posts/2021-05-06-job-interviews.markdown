Recently I left my job at SemaphoreCI after almost five years. I was in the mood to test the job market, though not pressed to start immediately. I pieced together a simple portfolio, and for a month followed remote job boards daily. In that span I sent a total of six applications, choosing from (1)&nbsp;What was open at the time, and (2)&nbsp;What matched my preferences. Four companies invited me for an interview: [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.com), [Grafana](https://grafana.com), and [Elastic](https://elastic.co). I never heard back from [Linear App](https://linear.app) and [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimedia.com). The experience was overall positive, though in the end, we didn’t come to an offer. And as it turned out, it was a good thing. Here’s how it was.

## Preferences

These were the guidelines I had in mind:

- **Fully remote, working from Europe.** Preferably operating on CET±4h, or ET±4h. Working for a PST centered company from Europe, in my experience, means to surrender your evenings to meetings way too often. I don’t have that enthusiasm anymore.

- **Senior+/Staff/Lead level jobs.** Ideally, a mix of hands-on designing and contributing strategically. What the exact designer’s duties are varies wildly on the stage in life of an organization. I just wanted to talk to as many different companies to get a better sense of the job market.

- **Continue in developer tools.** I now have a long experience solving developers’ problems and I grew to like the domain. Not many designers own that capital, and I imagined it would play to my advantage. Though, if I spot something exciting, I wouldn’t remain unreasonably rigid on this condition.

This “modest” window eliminated almost 4 out of 5 advertised jobs: (1) Half of all positions are limited to US/Canada, (2) Many aren’t senior level, and (3) Developer tools is a niche, which further reduced the available job pool. I did sent one application to Wikimedia. In that case I didn’t mind breaking my own rule, although I knew my background wouldn’t get them overly excited.

***

Without further ado, here’s how it went, grading from the best to worst experience. **Note that this only ranks my experience during the interviews.** It could be that working for these companies paints a completely different picture.

## Cloudflare · 5/5

**The Application.** The associations we have with certain products can be funny. I noticed [Cloudflare’s increased efforts in design](https://cloudflare.design/) a few years back. Person whose work I respect, [Adam Morse](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_) with his [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) (CSS toolkit I use to build this website), used to work there. I don’t know to what extent he influenced how they do design at Cloudflare, but I value his thinking and that’s partly the reason why I applied. Besides, it seemed like a company with mature, functioning design team I could learn from.

**The Process.** There was no screener interview. In the first email I was set up for a chat with a guy leading the European design team. It’s the person I’d be working with every day, case there’s a match. We had a great 45-minute call, enough for both sides to get the first impression. Meanwhile, I was in touch with the hiring team, sorting out my salary expectations, compensation, and such. I felt this was a perfectly balanced communication – _Move everything inessential to email_. They purged the process of unnecessary complexity, while keeping me well-informed and engaged.

**The Outcome.** Turned out they are remote only until the pandemic is over. The position was on-site in their newly established Lisbon office. That didn’t fit into my life plans and sadly I had to terminate the process. I don’t know how complex the remaining procedure would look like, had we moved forward. We both remained open to try again in future, in case they go fully remote. Nevertheless, 5-star hiring experience.

## GatsbyJS · 4/5

**The Application.** Their audience and problems were high match with my previous job. And I liked the potential of a company built on top of a vibrant open-source community. Not less important, I had good vibes from their [About Us](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/) page. Showing faces, being transparent and fully embracing remote work impressed me in a good way. No matter how naive that sounds. Finally, there were some familiar faces from the online dev community. All these small bits set them apart from countless faceless companies.

**The Process.** First there was a 30-minute screener interview, freestyling without a precise concept. “Talk to me about a time you had a conflict with a teammate.” I get it, but c’mon… Then, several days later, a more specific chat, with a fellow designer. And a week later with a product manager. At times the conversations felt too generic. The questions you would get from page 1 of googling “_designer interview questions_”. In the end, we all got what we want from each other, but it felt uneconomical. Though, throughout the entire thing the hiring team was very friendly and super-responsive.

**The Outcome.** I didn’t get the pass. They told me it was a close call between two candidates, and that they felt slightly better about the other person. Fair enough. I did receive feedback, but I had to ask for it several days later. When you immerse deep in the multi-week process, it makes sense to learn what you could improve, otherwise I wouldn’t bother to ask.

Overall, guys were great. Everyone I spoke to, either over email or in person, was extremely pleasant and respectful. But their process could use some refinement. There was little value in screener interview. Nothing that they couldn’t extract from briefly analyzing my application. The way I write, how literate I am, it takes two seconds to weed it out. And especially for designers who apply with portfolio. One brief look is enough to know if there’s potential. My final feedback: Just skip the screener altogether and set up candidates to talk with people they’d be working with every day. In the end: Great experience, 4-stars.

## Elastic · 4/5

**The Application.** Elastic was the only job from my list that closely matched my seniority preference. It was advertised as _Principal Product Designer_. It’s when you’re an expert senior who refrains from going fully into management, and prefer to still contribute individually. Also, part of the appeal was that Elastic is a behemoth of a company, with 2000+ employees, and a stable business model. So, potentially less stress and thinking on how we make money, and more focus on the specific design work.

**The Process.** We started of with a slightly stressful 30-minute screener. The guy was five minutes late, didn’t say anything, just started bombing me with questions. Before I was done answering one, he’d pass to another. At around 20-minute mark, he suddenly stopped the interview, and said I got a pass from him. I’m not a timid person, but this guy made me nervous. Even if not the greatest vibe, I appreciated his directness. In the next round, I had an hour long interview with another principal designer. He was tired, almost not wanting to be there, but we still had a good connection. I showed him my work in more detail, and explained my thinking and design process. I was learning how they ship software, and occasionally drifting over to talk about work and life balance. Overall I felt we connected pretty well.

**The Outcome.** To my surprise, it was a no from the designer guy. The hiring team followed with feedback, I paraphrase: “_We felt strong about your skills, but had doubts about your willingness to mentor_.” They closed the process saying I shouldn’t hesitate to get in touch directly if I’m interested in future openings. Underlining that the remarks they had wouldn’t haunt me forever in their internal notes.

The reason for rejection did bother me a tiny bit, I must admit. We spent less than 3 minutes talking about leadership. I remember us agreeing how challenging it is to manage people while hands-on contributing at the same time, and that was all. I think he confused management with mentoring. Mentoring happens every day. It’s impossible to become senior in any hierarchy without mentoring people along the way. But hey, you get one chance to make an impression. I didn’t, and that’s it. Finally, I give it 4-stars for the corporate-like interrogation from the first guy. Otherwise, everything else was great.

## Grafana · 1/5

**The Application.** On my previous job engineers used Grafana to monitor the performance of our app. And I had occasional encounters with the product, whenever we needed to pull the information that would indirectly inform design, finding pages with heaviest traffic, and such. I know everybody was praising the product. Moreover, they were hiring remote from Europe.

**The Process.** The process was over before it started. We scheduled a screener that never happened. Instead of me describing what happened, here’s our conversation below.

Here’s how it started…

But then, a minute before our meeting I received an email that we had to reschedule. Which is totally reasonable. Things like this happen all the time.

But then nothing. Not later, nor the following day.

I understand ghosting happen all the time in the hiring process. Companies can be heartless. But honestly I found this variation very strange. I really hope everything is ok with the girl.

A week after, I followed with an email, this time directly to the company, to check what happened. I wasn’t even into the job anymore, just curious about their explanation. They didn’t reply. For all the reasons, I can’t rate the experience interacting with Grafana other than 1-star. I still like their product and I hope they read this.
