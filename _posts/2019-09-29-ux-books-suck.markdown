Early in my career I was always in doubt with my process. I thought that I’d be doing myself a disservice if I wasn’t practicing how they design at Google or whatever company we were looking up to at the time.

I had no better idea where to look, but UX books, hoping I would learn how my most successful peers operate. But book after book, I consistently felt puzzled by abstract methods I’d had no idea what to do with.

The authors introduced me to concepts such as _Focus Groups_, _Market Segmentation_ or _Personas_ that felt so distant from my daily job that I wouldn’t know how to apply even if they held a gun pointed at me.

Years passed, I changed jobs, worked in various domains and different teams, my understanding of design matured, yet I still felt uncomfortable with _the most essential tools for UX designers_, how community routinely claimed.

At some point down the road I started wondering why is my experience so different from the theory that likely also originates from authors’ experience. Exploring their background have lead me to realize that most famous UX books were written either by academics trying to understand human behavior or practitioners working for big organizations. The tools and methods they were describing were developed to address the issues specific to a certain business (usually big corporation) or to an academic behavioral research. And even though many of the findings are incredibly insightful, I admit it took me years to understand I couldn’t just copy and paste it, as if it was some kind of a recipe.

In other words, what works for a 1000 people enterprise organization, rarely applies flawlessly to a 10 people company, let alone the UX design generally. And that it’s absolutely fine to mix, match and even invent whatever works in your specific context.

That is what has been skewing the picture for me for such a long time. Most tech companies today count less than 50 people and usually only a handful of designers. In such a setting, a designer's role is more general and work ships more liberally. We will rarely employ complex operations to validate every design decision but mostly operate in a trial and error routine.

Yet most of the time, the advice is coming from people with a different background. As a consequence, so many specific practices considered essential in the books feel irrelevant and out of touch with reality. It’s not that the books are bad or that the techniques are somehow broken, it’s just not how most of us do things every day.
