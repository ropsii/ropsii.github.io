What does a design leader do? The exact description of the role varies a lot. It indicates anything from a person operating a design team and mentoring designers, to commanding product, directing visual design, and often even contributing individually. It can be more strategic, more social or more artistic. Or a little bit of everything. In everyday life, leads usually cover several of these, if not all of them. How their routine looks like depends on the internal structure and the size of the organization. In small teams, by nature they do everything. Moving to more complex hierarchies of bigger enterprises, work tends to get more specific and they generally do more strategy and team management than hands-on designing.

There’s only a handful of people of extraordinary charisma and talent to inspire others. More often, leaders in our industry are just seasoned professionals who understand well-enough the business, organization and people, and work on removing the friction between them to achieve the common goal. They lead with understanding first, and personality only comes after.

Understanding comes with experience. You start seeing deeper, get more comfortable with complexity, and gain the knowledge and the ability to spot the intricate bits of work required to ship software. And then you communicate that all the time to everybody you work with. For anyone to listen, you have to be reputable. To have previously been there. If you’re also a likeable person, even better, people will take less effort to get on board with what you’re telling them. And that’s leadership in a nutshell.

Let’s now break down the career path and several different incarnations of design leaders.

## The Basics

First and foremost, you gotta have the willingness to do the boring stuff and contribute strategically, instead, for example, to design or write code following someone else’s directions. Once you start recognizing how design fits the bigger picture, what your work means for the users and for the organization, you are one step closer to being a leader.

Some people deliberately stay forever in this stage. They simply


Many people, myself included, find a great pleasure in designing, even . Sometimes the internal structure of the organization allows you to continue doing just that, only at a more senior level. Some call it _staff_ or _principal_ designer. Or lead. But leadership comes in many flavors. It doesn’t necessarily imply managing people.

Building software, design needs to find its fit. That’s where a good leader can help. There used to be a lot of talk about the importance of design, getting “the seat at the table”, and such silliness. I feel it has matured. Today there’s better overall understanding of how design fits an organization, as one of its building blocks, no less or more important




I’m in a stage of my career where I make impact at strategic level, but still find a great pleasure in contributing individually. Some companies now have this role for people like me. GitHub calls is _staff_ designer, some other companies have it under _principal_ or _lead_ designer. Bu


Mentorship happens at any point of interaction with other people

What a good design leader does?
- Gets involved in strategy and thinks how design can help
- Understands the system and breaks down complex projects into simpler tasks
- Secures conditions for others to flourish
- Helps unblocking others
- Delegates work to other people


Yet, the role of a design leader vary wildly between different organizations.

For the most of my career I’ve been working in fairly small teams, never more than 30 people. And never more than a handful of other designers around.
