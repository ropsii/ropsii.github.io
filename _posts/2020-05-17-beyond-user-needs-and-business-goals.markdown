People just starting out in digital design are commonly driven by a simple desire to make things pretty. In the beginning there’s almost no greater goal, we’re moving shapes, colors and words around, trying to make them look nice together. You could argue our reasoning is still naively selfish.

Soon after we begin to discover the functional importance of our work and how it impacts people. Around that point we start to talk about users and _satisfying their needs_. It’s not about us anymore, not only what makes us feel good, but what makes people interacting with our software happy.  And ideally it has enough value so that some people are willing to pay for it.

[UX theory]({% post_url 2019-09-29-ux-books-suck %}) usually stops there. As it is most commonly defined, user experience design is about _harmonizing the needs of users with the goals of business_. “The goals of business” usually equalling profit. If a product is making money, things are good. And if you don’t happen to work in public services, academia, open-source or any other of the rare cases where creating wealth isn’t essential – profitability is about the only relevant metric that determines how good of a work you’re doing with your product.

That sounds like a fair exchange. Only the reality is slightly darker. What happens when businesses are motivated only by maximizing profit, at some point they grow so big they become blind for people and their lives. And they eventually become harmful to the society.

So even when you’re, as an individual, under a strong impression that you’re working in the best interest of your users, you’re unconsciously drawn into a disguised destructive activity.

## How your design melts ice caps?

Say, you’re a designer at Google Maps. One of my favorite products ever, I use it every day. You deliver honest work and you go home proud of yourself and your team every day, sincerely believing you’re making the world a better place for the entire humanity. But besides helping people find places more easily, your talent has been implicitly exploited for making the biggest surveillance machine in the history of mankind. And its genuine intention is really pathetic.

Google gives us the most amazing maps ever for free, but in exchange they track us everywhere, they learn everything about our habits, what we eat, how much we earn, who our friends and our lovers are, how rich they are, how rich are our parents, who we went to school with, where we spend our holidays, do we prefer beaches or museums, rock or country, they can even easily figure out if we’re having an affair if they really wanted to… All that just so they can make us spend more money buying things. Next thing you know, we consume 10× of what we really need, oceans are drowning in our plastic, struggle to regulate the temperature, ice polar caps melt and we all die.

## The moral of recycling

But hey, we’re all guilty of this together. It’s a systemic disease. The economic and moral framework we live in is like a software designed so badly it’s continually damaging the computer it is running on.

I know how naive this sounds, but I cope with this by choosing jobs whose impact I can imagine as at least neutral to the society. For example _renting_ my work to companies building software tools that makes someone’s life better. And avoid marketing and advertising software whose only immediate goal is only to pump spending. Even though, at the end of the day, you can’t avoid participating in the system, so it almost doesn’t matter.

For the same reason some of us separate waste. Or buy organic. We unconsciously know our individual action doesn’t do shit, but we still do it. To make small acts of solidarity with nature. To be at peace with ourselves.
