      <p><strong>Hello.</strong> I design user interfaces. On my last job I lead a thorough redesign of <a href="https:www.activecollab.com">Active Collab</a>, a robust project management software. Before that, for years I was ½ of <a href="http://sprawsm.com">Superawesome</a> – a small shop practicing design for the screen.</p>
      <p>I like this <strong>approach</strong> to UI design — To make great interfaces, we have to understand what jobs people want to do and design to support these jobs. Thinking in jobs makes good sense because it helps us focus on solving the right problems. ☞ <a href="https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done">Jobs-to-be-Done</a> explores this. It’s not easy, but I’m humbly trying to get better at it. Likewise, over time I learned to appreciate some aspects of ☞ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652">Lean UX</a>. Particularly the idea of involving non designers to take part in design and the value it adds to the product and to team chemistry.</p>
      <p><strong>Aesthetically</strong>, I have confidence in well set typography, polite interaction and careful wordsmithing.</p>

      <p>Active Collab is huge. It’s a project management tool, but also does invoicing, time tracking as well as estimating and reporting. Over the years it grew pretty difficult to use. I joined the team with the ambitious task of reinventing the <a href="https://www.uie.com/articles/experience_rot/">rotting user experience</a> of the app from scratch.</p>

      <p>I was the only designer on our three person lean team. My generalist role combined strategy planning, research, IA, interaction, visual design and occasionally a lightweight frontend coding. I wrote an exhaustive ✏ <a href="https://blog.activecollab.com/redesigning-active-collab-393608cb019b">Article about the process</a>.</p>

      <p>It took two years before we shipped. Researching and trying to answer weather some features are <a href="https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27#.w3oz3560y">doing the job</a> or not (and thus should they exist at all) received the most of our attention.</p>

      <p>Visual design, although a valuable component of the overall experience, came second in the burdensome process where great majority of work consisted of researching, analyzing, discussing and most of all — thinking.</p>

      <p>Besides heavy lifting, at a later stage I’ve done a good deal of illustration and icon design. We established a living style guide in an effort to keep things in order both logically and visually on such a colossal system.</p>

      <p>We ended up with a system that felt simple and lightweight while it preserved all of its original power. It’s still far from complete, like any digital design, but the biggest gain is a great evolution in thinking from a technology-first company to a team that worships user experience and builds technology on top of it. ❧</p>

      <p>I spent a short autumn with a NYC based startup at its very beginnings. At this stage we were still exploring what the product might become. Originally it was supposed to be a location based service for sharing experiences, but it somewhat shifted over time.</p>

      <p>Most of the work was just static mockups, images that served the purpose in the discovery phase. Unfortunately, not a lot of mature UX work was done although some early signs of how the flow might work were investigated along the way.</p>
